# Bugs, Opportunities, Future Development, and Lessons Learned

- In this project we used a single database table for project time efficiency.  Single database would be ok for a small eCommerce site but would be inefficient for a large scale business.  For a larger business there would be different databases based on prouduct, vendor, and financials. SQL tools would be needed to merge various databased based on the business objective.

- Agile development method is necessary for creating the best product. Each participant had to change direction several times to meet various needs of the project.

- Developers will spend hours researching.

- Current bug: issues with remove items from cart.  Cart is removing all items instead of specific items.

- Future development: separating the products into various tables and then using SQL tools to merge relevant data into the "shopping cart".

- Future development: creating a "buyer's tool".  The "buyer's tool" would be used by the company's product catagory teams to update their product's information.

_ Future development: database for customer purchase history.
